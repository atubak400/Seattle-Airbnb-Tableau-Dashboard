## Goal
Create Tableau project using the Seattle Airbnb dataset and build a dashboard with:

- Revenue over Time (weekly line for 2016)
- Avg Price per Bedroom (bar)
- Count of Listings per Bedroom (bar)

## Folder guide
- data/raw: original dataset files (CSV, Excel)
- data/processed: cleaned or combined datasets used in Tableau
- tableau/workbook: Tableau workbook files (.twb / .twbx)
- tableau/exports: exported images/PDFs from Tableau
- tableau/screenshots: screenshots for portfolio and README
- docs: documentation (steps, notes, writeups)
